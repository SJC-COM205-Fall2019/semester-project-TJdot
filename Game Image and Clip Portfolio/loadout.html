    <h2>
      <p>The three classes are Hunter, Titan, and Warlock. Their names summarize them strongly. As such, I took it upon myself to restrict each class to weapons fitting to them. </p>
      
      <p>For example, a Hunter embodies precision, so he'd be the one to use sniper rifles or hand cannons, a Titan that uses brute force would favor auto rifles and shotguns. A Warlock of knowledge is the user of fusion rifles. It gets far more specific than that, but to explain everything would take forever.</p>
      <p>Each class also has three subclasses that utilize the main three elements of the game, Solar (red), Arc (blue), and Void (purple). These and/or one of the unique exotic armor pieces is what I use to base my color choices off of for the armor of each loadout. The loadouts themselves are defined by the exotic armor. </p>
      <p>Destiny 2 allowed weapons to be colored as well, so I used this oppertunity to designate a color shader to each element within a set of weapons. Should a shotgun be void, it gets the void shader. If a sniper in the same family is solar, it gets the solar one.</p>
      <p>Nowadays, I struggle to continue this due to player gear vault not receiving more space as more gear has become available to collect. To a lot, it looks like hoarding but I see it as trying to use everything I can to make all the possible ways to fight in style that I can imagine.</p>
